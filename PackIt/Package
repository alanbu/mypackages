Utility to help create Packages

 Creates most common types of binary packages for use with the RISC OS Packaging Project.
 Binary packages are anything where the package is not built from source code or where
 the source code is not made available.
 It can also be used as a starting point to create the control files for
 more complicated binary packages or source code packages.
