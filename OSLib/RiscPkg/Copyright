The  copyright holders have granted  a relaxation of the conditions of this
licence to allow its use in constructing proprietary  software.  This means
that  it  is  free software  itself,  but applications linked to it need not
be.  It follows that any changes to  OSLib itself (the contents of the
directories Tools, Source, and OSLibSupport) fall under the terms of the GNU
Public Licence; but programmes written using OSLib do not.
